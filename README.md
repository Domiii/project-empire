# project-empire


* Users can group up and go on projects (after picking from a vast list of missions)
* Each project is completed in one or more sprints
  * ![sprint](http://www.dgc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/agile-sprint.jpg)
* At the end of each sprint, there is a "Demo & Feedback" meeting 『團隊鑑定』

* 準備/上課 SOP: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PEDof6WXYTD4ejQWoBBlglemhnPD9OAx_4yTjyRLcBw/edit#slide=id.g1feab3d031_0_9

## TODO


#### Motivation
`rrf v2.0` does not use `immutable` anymore, so `reselect` won't be of any help with data caching.


#### Solution
  1. During `render` call, use pre-compiled `getPath` helper function to access any data
  1. Wrap the `getPath` method to remember the set of all accessed data paths of **this and any child components**.
  1. Use `reselect` to produce the getters?
  1. Override `shouldComponentUpdate` to return true if and only if: (data at any of the given paths have changed (shallow comparison)) `or` (initially, when it has not rendered at least once)).
